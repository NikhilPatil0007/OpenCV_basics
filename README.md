# OpenCV Basics

## Overview
This project showcases fundamental concepts and techniques in OpenCV, one of the most widely used computer vision libraries. The implementation covers image and video processing tasks, making it a practical resource for beginners and intermediate learners to explore computer vision concepts.

## Features
- **Image Processing:**
  - Working with color spaces (BGR, RGB, HSV, etc.).
  - Thresholding and masking.
  - Smoothing and blurring techniques.
  
- **Drawing and Bitwise Operations:**
  - Drawing shapes and text on images.
  - Bitwise operations for masking and blending images.

- **Feature Detection:**
  - Contour detection.
  - Edge detection using gradients.
  - Face detection using Haar cascades.

- **Transformations:**
  - Image rescaling.
  - Geometric transformations (rotation, translation, etc.).

- **Histogram Analysis:**
  - Plotting and analyzing histograms for image intensity distributions.

## File Structure
